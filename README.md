# Mitochondrial_dynamics_EGT
Using evolutionary game theory to model mitochondrial fission and fusion events in neural cells. 

We simulate three different cell types, the first a nomral cell where mitochondria are able to undergo 
both fission and fusion. The second cell type represents an abnormal cell, where fission is impaired (blocked),
and the final cell type is another abnormal cell where fusion is blocked. 

The dynamics of these cells are tracked as a fission/fusion ratio, the ATP production and ROS production.
